1. Overview

    NVSim models the area, timing, dynamic energy and 
    leakage power of Phase-Change Memory (PCM), Spin-
    Torque-Transfer RAM (STT-RAM), Resistive RAM
    (ReRAM) or memristor, Floating Body Dynamic RAM
    (FBDRAM) and Single-Level Cell NAND Flash.
    NVSim uses the same modeling principles as the
    well-known CACTI, but it starts from scratch on
    the basis of a brand-new frame work with more
    flexibility in terms of bank/mat/subarray
    organization and periphral circuitry design. Such
    flexibility is necessary for emerging non-volatile
    memory technologies as the current status of most 
    emerging NVMs is unknown. Thanks for trying NVSim!


------------------------------------------------------

2. Compiling NVSim

    NVSim is programmed under GNU C++, and it can be 
    compiled on both Unix-like OSes and Microsoft 
    Windows 

    2a. Under Linux

        The tool can be built using make:

        $ make

        Running through make will automatically set 
        the compile flags needed.


------------------------------------------------------

3. Running NVSim


    If no .cfg file is specified, NVSim will load the 
    default configuration file (nvsim.cfg)

    $ ./nvsim

    Actually, users can specify their own configurations
    by passing the ".cfg" argument.

    $ ./nvsim <custom>.cfg
    

------------------------------------------------------

4. Configuring NVSim


    NVSim can be configured using the configuration files.
    Several example configuration files can be found in
    the root directory of the source code. Note that most
    of the configuration files are specified with small
    capacity (< 128MB) as the current version of NVSim 
    only models a single-bank. Multi-bank cache/memory is
    in the to-do list of NVSim 2.0.

    For example, 
    sample_STTRAM_cache.cfg - A 8MB STT-RAM cache (both 
    data and array) configured for design space exploration
    sample_PCRAM.cfg - A 16MB PCM macro with fixed bank 
    organization (H-tree, internal sensing)
    sample_RRAM.cfg - A 2MB ReRAM macro with fixed bank
    organization (bus-manner routing, external sensing)
    A more detailed listing of configuration parameter 
    names and potential values are on the NVSim wiki page.

5. Hacking NVSim


    As mentioned in the overview, NVSim is meant to 
    be flexible. Another level of flexibility is 
    enabled when experts in NVM design Write their own
    sense amplifier, voltage plane, charge pump
    circuiitry etc. This can be done by creating a new
    C++ file with a new class and instantiate the new
    class in corresponding component.

Please refer to the following paper for a general
introduction of the tool,
"NVSim: A Circuit-Level Performance, Energy and Area
Model for Emerging Nonvolatile Memory", IEEE TCAD 2012

At the mean time, we are working on the documentation
of a detailed technical report. If you have any comments,
questions, or suggestions please contact us via email.
